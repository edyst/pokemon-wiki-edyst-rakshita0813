      <p>Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as
        part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games
        released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also
        referred as the "core series" by their developers. </p>

            Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

    <h2>Q and A</h2>

      <h3>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ques_ans_list">
      <ol>
        <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is
            essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu,
            mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity.
            Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers
            should be able to answer.
          </li>
          <li> Answer is Raichu</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but
            progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who
            emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where
            you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button
            mashing at all is required.
          </li>
          <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

          Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type
          matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different
          multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in
          line.
